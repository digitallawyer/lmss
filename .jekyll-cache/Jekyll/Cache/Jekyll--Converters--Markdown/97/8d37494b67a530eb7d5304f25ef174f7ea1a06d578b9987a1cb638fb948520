			<h1>LMSS Structure</h1>
		</header>
		<h3>1. Overview</h3>
		<p>The LMSS document is comprised of a Header and one or more Matters. The Header and the Matter(s) are containers. Each container has elements that may be of type Text, Numeric, Enumeration or Container. Enumerations are stored in Text(250) fields to accommodate multiple levels of specificity that are represented as concatenated codes. Containers are pointers to other structures.
		</p>
		<p>A well-formed Document is a structure that includes all required fields. (Note that the concept of a well-formed document applies to instance but not templates or queries.) In the tables below, ‚ÄúREQ‚Äù indicates whether the element is required (in an LMSS instance but not a query), ‚ÄúMULT‚Äù indicates whether multiple values are permitted. A well-formed document is required in the interchange of instances of matters between systems. A well-formed document is not required when the LMSS is used in a query. In those instances, a missing field matches all instances. See LMSS Queries below.
		</p>
		<h3>2. Document</h3>
		<p>The Document container is the top-level container in the LMSS instance. The Document must have a Header and one or more Matters.</p>

		<h4>3.1. Title</h4>
		<p>An optional title for the document.</p>
		<h4>3.2. Version</h4>
		<p>The LMSS version is defined and maintained by SALI. Published version of the standard may be found at Sali.org.</p>
		<h4>3.3. Type</h4>
		<p>Type refers to the type of the Document. Permissible values include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Instance ‚Äì An instance encodes a specific matter. Instances have required containers and elements to be well formed.</li>
			<li>Template ‚Äì A template encodes default settings of an instance. Parts of templates that are not specified are assumed to accept all values. Templates must adhere to the LMSS container structure, however required elements are relaxed.
			</li>
			<li>Query ‚Äì A query encodes a database query following a SQL-like structure. Queries have select, where, order by and limit structures.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>3.4. Language</h4>
		<p>Language declares the default language of the LMSS structure. Languages follow the Internet Engineering Task Force recommendation in BCP 47.
		</p>
		<h4>3.5. Charset</h4>
		<p>The charset describes the encoding of the characters in the LMSS document. The default encoding is UTF-8.
		</p>
		<h4>3.6. Extension Link</h4>
		<p>A link to an extension file that conforms to the LMSS Extension file format.</p>
		<h3>4. Extension</h3>
		<p>An extension container is an in-document definition of an extension. A document may include an array of these in the header. The scope applies to the document.

<p>The LMSS Code of the code set. (See 6.1)</p>
&lt;h4line-end=5 &gt;<a id="442_Code_4"></a>4.4.2 Code&lt;/h4&gt;
<p>The code assigned to the extension. The code will have a ‚Äú@‚Äù prepended to it when<br />
used.</p>
&lt;h4line-end=10 &gt;<a id="443_Parent_9"></a>4.4.3 Parent&lt;/h4&gt;
<p>The parent code. The parent code must be an existing standard code in the code set, or<br />
a previously defined extension. Examples include ‚ÄúRES‚Äù or ‚Äú@OFFICE‚Äù.</p>
<h4 data-line-end="15"><a id="444_Name_14"></a>4.4.4 Name</h4>
<p>The short name of extension code.</p>
&lt;h3data-line-end=20 &gt;<a id="45_Declaration_19"></a>4.5 Declaration&lt;/h3&gt;
<p>A declaration may be used to assign and index to an item to ensure accurate cross<br />
referencing. Declarations are typically used for legal entities but can be used in place of<br />
a Name (See 4.10.1, 4.11.1 and 4.11.2).<br />
A legal person or entity is any human or non-human entity, in other words, any human<br />
being, firm, or government agency that is recognized as having privileges and<br />
obligations, such as having the ability to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.<br />
Entities are used to maintain referential integrity across LMSS structure. For example, if<br />
the matter includes two processes that refer to the same legal entity as in the example,<br />
‚ÄúReview and negotiate project labor agreement for Jane Smith.‚Äù The matter may be<br />
encoded to have two processes ‚Äì one for review and another of negotiation. But the<br />
review and negotiation are the same legal entity. An entity declaration should be used in<br />
this instance and the entity NameID should be used in each process to ensure that it is<br />
understood that the objects of both process are the same.<br />
ELEMENT REQ. MULT. TYPE COMMENTS<br />
NameID Y N Text(40) The NameID of the entity. Must be of the<br />
regular expression form ^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,39}<br />
Name Y N Text(250) Name to be inserted wherever the NameID<br />
appears</p>
<h4 data-line-end="41"><a id="451_NameID_40"></a>4.5.1 NameID</h4>
<p>The ID to be used in place of a name. NameIDs must begin with a caret symbol. (e.g.<br />
^102 or ^EntityXYZ).</p>
<h4 data-line-end="46"><a id="452_Name_45"></a>4.5.2 Name</h4>
<p>The name to be used in place of the NameID.</p>
&lt;h3data-line-end=50 &gt;<a id="46_Matter_49"></a>4.6 Matter&lt;/h3&gt;
<p>The Matter container encapsulates the information for a matter. There may be more<br />
than one matter per document. The matter must have a title, a human readable<br />
description, a locale and one or more processes. The locale may restrict the types of<br />
the processes. For example, certain bankruptcy processes are limited to the US<br />
because those processes a defined by US Bankruptcy law.</p>

&lt;h3data-line-end=76 &gt;<a id="47_Narrative_75"></a>4.7 Narrative&lt;/h3&gt;
<p>A narrative holds a group of related matter descriptions. It includes a required type<br />
which is an enumerated list, an optional usage tag, and an optional source. Each<br />
narrative can have a specified usage so a Matter can have multiple narratives based on<br />
the audience. each narrative is intended to capture a logically unique matter<br />
interpretation of the matter. Formatting and language variants are accommodated in the<br />
description container.</p>

<h4 data-line-end="103"><a id="472_Usage_102"></a>4.7.2 Usage</h4>
<p>Usage is an optional human readable field that should capture the audience or usage of<br />

finance pitches.‚Äù</p>
<h4 data-line-end="110"><a id="473_Source_109"></a>4.7.3 Source</h4>
<p>The source is an optional element that describe the source of the narrative. You may<br />
provide multiple sources. Examples include: ‚Äú2015 litigation department compensation<br />

&lt;h3data-line-end=116 &gt;<a id="48_Description_115"></a>4.8 Description&lt;/h3&gt;
<p>The description is an container encapsulates the specific text of a specific narrative. The<br />
description has text, a format and a language. If the language is not specified, it is<br />
inherited from the matter. For example, if a firm keeps French and English versions of<br />
the same narrative, or plain text and HTML formatted versions of the same narrative,<br />
these would be accommodated in the description container.<br />

<p>The Process container describes the process, service or product being delivered.<br />
Every process must have a single process type. Top-level process types are<br />
transactions, disputes, regulatory proceedings, bankruptcy/restructurings, and advisory.<br />
If we think of the process as a sentence, the process type reprints the ‚Äúverb.‚Äù They<br />
describe the action that is being taken.<br />
The players are the legal entities involved in the process. These should be thought of<br />
the subject (Joe Smith) and object (Company X) in the sentence ‚ÄúJoe Smith sued<br />
Company X for $500,000 for breach of contract.‚Äù<br />
The process predicate contains the predecessors or outcomes of the process. In the<br />
sentence above, ‚Äúfor $500,000‚Äù and ‚Äúfor breach of contract.‚Äù<br />
The Area of Law provides context to the process. The area of law should be thought of<br />
the primary subject of law for the process ‚Äî think the class that‚Äôs the attorney was in<br />
when she learned about the applicable law. The area of law is provided primarily for<br />
context as in the examples, ‚ÄúHe prosecuted the defendant‚Äù and ‚ÄúShe prosecuted the<br />
patent.‚Äù The first is criminal law, the second is intellectual property law.</p>
