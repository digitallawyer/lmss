<h2 id="1-overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>The LMSS document is comprised of a Header and one or more Matters. The Header
and the Matter(s) are containers Each container has elements that may be of type Text,
Numeric, Enumeration or Container. Enumerations are stored in Text(250) fields to
accommodate multiple levels of specificity that are represented as concatenated codes.
Containers are pointers to other structures.</p>

<p>A well-formed Document is a structure that includes all required fields. (Note that the
concept of a well-formed document applies to instance but not templates or queries.) In
the tables below, â€œREQâ€ indicates whether the element is required (in an LMSS instance
but not a query), â€œMULTâ€ indicates whether multiple values are permitted. A well-formed
document is required in the interchange of instances of matters between systems. A
well-formed document is not required when the LMSS is used in a query. In those
instances, a missing field matches all instances. See LMSS Queries below.</p>

<h2 id="2-document">2 Document</h2>

<p>The Document container is the top-level container in the LMSS instance. The Document
must have a Header and one or more Matters.

<p>Type refers to the type of the Document. Permissible values include:
ï‚· Instance â€“ An instance encodes a specific matter. Instances have required
containers and elements to be well formed.
ï‚· Template â€“ A template encodes default settings of an instance. Parts of
templates that are not specified are assumed to accept all values. Templates
must adhere to the LMSS container structure, however required elements are
relaxed.
ï‚· Query â€“ A query encodes a database query following a SQL-like structure.
Queries have select, where, order by and limit structures.</p>

<h4 id="434-language">4.3.4 Language</h4>

<p>Language declares the default language of the LMSS structure. Languages follow the
Internet Engineering Task Force recommendation in BCP 47.</p>

<h4 id="441-code-set">4.4.1 Code Set</h4>

<p>The LMSS Code of the code set. (See 6.1)</p>

<h4 id="442-code">4.4.2 Code</h4>

<p>The code assigned to the extension. The code will have a â€œ@â€ prepended to it when
used.</p>

<h4 id="443-parent">4.4.3 Parent</h4>

<p>The parent code. The parent code must be an existing standard code in the code set, or

<h4 id="444-name">4.4.4 Name</h4>

<p>The short name of extension code.</p>

<h3 id="45-declaration">4.5 Declaration</h3>

<p>A declaration may be used to assign and index to an item to ensure accurate cross
referencing. Declarations are typically used for legal entities but can be used in place of
a Name (See 4.10.1, 4.11.1 and 4.11.2).
A legal person or entity is any human or non-human entity, in other words, any human
being, firm, or government agency that is recognized as having privileges and
obligations, such as having the ability to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.
Entities are used to maintain referential integrity across LMSS structure. For example, if
the matter includes two processes that refer to the same legal entity as in the example,
â€œReview and negotiate project labor agreement for Jane Smith.â€ The matter may be
encoded to have two processes â€“ one for review and another of negotiation. But the
review and negotiation are the same legal entity. An entity declaration should be used in
this instance and the entity NameID should be used in each process to ensure that it is
understood that the objects of both process are the same.
ELEMENT REQ. MULT. TYPE COMMENTS
NameID Y N Text(40) The NameID of the entity. Must be of the
regular expression form \^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,39}

<h3 id="46-matter">4.6 Matter</h3>

<p>The Matter container encapsulates the information for a matter. There may be more
than one matter per document. The matter must have a title, a human readable
description, a locale and one or more processes. The locale may restrict the types of
the processes. For example, certain bankruptcy processes are limited to the US
because those processes a defined by US Bankruptcy law.</p>

narrative can have a specified usage so a Matter can have multiple narratives based on
the audience. each narrative is intended to capture a logically unique matter
interpretation of the matter. Formatting and language variants are accommodated in the
description container.</p>

these would be accommodated in the description container.

<p>The Process container describes the process, service or product being delivered.

If we think of the process as a sentence, the process type reprints the â€œverb.â€ They
describe the action that is being taken.
The players are the legal entities involved in the process. These should be thought of
the subject (Joe Smith) and object (Company X) in the sentence â€œJoe Smith sued
Company X for $500,000 for breach of contract.â€
The process predicate contains the predecessors or outcomes of the process. In the
sentence above, â€œfor $500,000â€ and â€œfor breach of contract.â€
The Area of Law provides context to the process. The area of law should be thought of
the primary subject of law for the process â€” think the class thatâ€™s the attorney was in
when she learned about the applicable law. The area of law is provided primarily for
context as in the examples, â€œHe prosecuted the defendantâ€ and â€œShe prosecuted the
patent.â€ The first is criminal law, the second is intellectual property law.</p>

<h2 id="5-the-legal-matter-application-programming-interfaces-apis">5 The Legal Matter Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</h2>

<p>LMSS APIs are not supported in Draft LMSS 1. 0 Rev 2.
The LMSS supports several types of APIs:
ï‚· LMSS Instance
ï‚· LMSS Queries
ï‚· LMSS UI/Sych API</p>

<h3 id="51-lmss-instance">5.1 LMSS Instance</h3>

<p>The Instance API is used to create, import and export matters. It also supports default
values and user-defined extensions.
ï‚· Helps create conforming matters
ï‚· Validates matter structures
ï‚· Supports user-defined extensions</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ï‚· Supports default values/templates
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="52-lmss-queries">5.2 LMSS Queries</h3>

<p>An important part of the LMSS is to support the querying of data stores against different
criteria. The standard leverages the LMSS definition â€” structure, enumerated values,
text and numeric values â€” to specify search criteria. In these instances sparse version
of the LMSS are applied to develop search criteria.</p>

<h4 id="521-lmss-query-where-clauses">5.2.1 LMSS Query WHERE Clauses</h4>

<p>In the standard SQL queries clauses SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY, the LMSS
template can be used to define the WHERE clauses.
For enumerated values that are filled in, the search uses the â€œstarts withâ€ criteria for
specifying a search. For text and numeric fields, you can apply standard SQL wildcard
matching.
Below are several examples of how this applied.
