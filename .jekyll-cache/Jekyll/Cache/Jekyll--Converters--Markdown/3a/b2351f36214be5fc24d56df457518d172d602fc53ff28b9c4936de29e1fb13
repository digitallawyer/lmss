<h2 id="1-overview">1 Overview</h2>

<p>The SALI Legal Matter Specification Standard (LMSS) was developed by the Standards
for the Advancement of the Legal Industry (SALI) Alliance to provide a standard way for
parties to specify, describe and exchange information describing legal services at the
matter level throughout a legal matter‚Äôs lifecycle. The SALI LMSS is designed to
function as a worldwide legal matter standard.</p>

<h3 id="11-what-do-we-mean-by-a-legal-matter">1.1 What do we mean by a ‚Äúlegal matter‚Äù?</h3>

<p>For the purpose of the LMSS, a Legal Matter is considered to be any group of activities
for the purposes of delivering a legal service to one or more parties. The activities are
either a major project with start and end point (e.g. litigation, acquisition of a business, a
regulatory filing, etc.) or a grouping of micro projects (e.g. advice).</p>

<h3 id="12-what-do-we-mean-by-the-legal-matter-lifecycle">1.2 What do we mean by the ‚Äúlegal matter lifecycle‚Äù?</h3>

<p>The legal matter lifecycle means the description of the matter from its conception as a
request for services through its inception and execution through closing. Because the
LMSS must support a matter that will evolve through its lifecycle, it is designed
accommodate the evolution of the matter without jeopardizing the integrity of systems
that are depending on data provided at an earlier stage of the matter.</p>

<h3 id="13-what-are-the-components-of-the-lmss">1.3 What are the components of the LMSS?</h3>

<p>The SALI LMSS has following components:
ÔÇ∑ The legal matter specification includes: structure, allowed values, and
dependencies and supports both matter instances (the description of specific
matters), and matter templates (the description of classes of matters).
ÔÇ∑ The legal matter application programming interfaces (APIs) include: the
transport API for exchanging data and the UX API for supporting the user
interface of applications that use the standard.</p>

<h2 id="2-design-principles">2 Design Principles‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.</h2>

<p>The SALI LMSS was designed using the following principles:</p>

<h3 id="21-playerviewer-independence">2.1 Player/Viewer independence</h3>

<p>The standard is designed to provide clear guidance and party-independent enumerated
values to ensure that matters are encoded the same way independent of the party
involved in matter. As an example, the standard supports terms such as ‚Äúplaintiff‚Äù and
‚Äúdefendant‚Äù which have the same meaning no matter who is looking at the matter over
terms like ‚Äúclient‚Äù and ‚Äúopposing party‚Äù which change depending upon a player‚Äôs role in
the matter.</p>

<h3 id="22-successive-refinement-and-additive-coding">2.2 Successive refinement and additive coding</h3>

<p>Because the LMSS is intended to be used legal matters to describe legal matters that
are being executed, the standard implements hierarchical and additive coding. As an
example, when a matter begins, the area of law for a matter may not yet be fully
determined, for example, we may know that it is a environmental matter, but not what
specialty in environmental law. Such a matter would initially be encoded as
environmental ‚Äì ENVT. At a later point it may be determined that the matter is an air
quality matter ‚Äì AIRQ. This would be encoded as ‚ÄúENVT-AIRQ‚Äù The successive code is
added to the previous code and is a further refinement of the previous code. This design
ensure that other systems that depend upon the initial restructuring code continue to
work.
Furthermore, each code in a code set is guaranteed to be unique, and each code is
guaranteed to have a single parent code. This means that if you simply use the code
‚ÄúAIRQ‚Äù, the full coding path ‚ÄúENVT-AIRQ‚Äù can be derived. In cases where the SALI
standard has adopted codes from other standards that don‚Äôt adhere to this requirement,
the ‚Äú+‚Äù notation is used. For example both US, California and El Salvador, Cardenas
use the same ISO code ‚ÄúCA‚Äù. To distinguish these, the cod is prepended with the
parent code followed by a ‚Äú+‚Äù. USA (‚ÄúUS‚Äù), California (‚ÄúCA‚Äù) is coded as ‚ÄúUS+CA‚Äù; El
Salvador (‚ÄúSV‚Äù), Cardenas (‚ÄúCA‚Äù) is coded as ‚ÄúCV+CA‚Äù.</p>

<h3 id="23-standards-based">2.3 Standards based</h3>

<p>The LMSS is built on and incorporates existing international standards in addition to
specifying new codes applicable to the legal services domain.</p>

<h3 id="24-extensible">2.4 Extensible</h3>

<p>Since the LMSS cannot anticipate all needs, there is a well-defined way to extend the
standard while staying within the design and API functionality. There is a methodology
for providing including private structural components and private allowable values that
at some point may be submitted and considered for incorporation into to future versions
of the LMSS.</p>

<h3 id="25-agile-approach">2.5 Agile approach</h3>

<p>The LMSS is designed using an agile approach wherein the proposed standard drafts
are revised and tested by a broad group of stakeholders representing law firms, clients
and solution providers to ensure that the standard is practical and appropriate to the
specific needs and use cases being addressed.
The process is as follows is described in the table below:
Name Description Comment
Draft LMSS 1.0 Rev. 1 First draft revision 1 of the
LMSS 1.0 specification
The first version always had
the word ‚ÄúDraft‚Äù and ‚ÄúRev.
&lt;#&gt;‚Äù in its title.
Draft LMSS 1.0 Rev <n> Nth draft revision 1 of the
LMSS 1.0 specification
Foe each successive draft,
the revision number is
incremented.
LMMS 1.0 Final version of the LMSS
1.0 standard
"Draft" and "Rev. &lt;#&gt;" are
removed from the title once
the standard is adopted by
SALI Alliance members.
Draft LMSS 2.0 Rev 1 First draft revision 1 of the
LMSS 2.0 specification
Successive versions of the
standard will increment
LMSS number.</n></p>

<h2 id="3-legal-matter-specification-lmss-components">3 Legal Matter Specification (LMSS) Components</h2>

<p>The legal matter specification includes the following components:
ÔÇ∑ structure,
ÔÇ∑ allowed values,
ÔÇ∑ dependencies, and,
ÔÇ∑ extensions.
In addition, the LMSS supports both:
ÔÇ∑ matter instances (the description of specific matters), and
ÔÇ∑ matter templates (the description of classes of matters).</p>

<h3 id="31-lmss-structure">3.1 LMSS Structure</h3>

<p>The LMSS Structure specifies where descriptive elements of matter are stored and how
those elements relate to each other. The structure is comprised of components called
‚Äúcontainers.‚Äù Containers can be thought of as tables in a relational database. The
structure defines structure of each container ‚Äì its elements ‚Äì how containers relate to
each other, which elements are required and which are optional, and whether the
relationship between containers are one-to-one or one-to-many.
The LMSS structure can be expressed as a database schema for storage or an XML or
JSON structure for transmission of the matter information.</p>

<h3 id="32-lmss-allowed-values">3.2 LMSS Allowed Values</h3>

<p>The LMSS Allowed Values specify the type of information that may be stored in different
elements of the containers. Allowed values fall into the following categories:</p>

<h4 id="321-enumerated-values">3.2.1 Enumerated Values</h4>

<p>Enumerated values are specifically defined values that are allowed at permitted as
values of specific container elements.
The LMSS relies extensively on enumerated values to ensure that common definitions
across systems and languages. Some standards are officially incorporated in the
standard such as ISO- 4217 , which provides standard codes standard names codes for
currencies.
Enumerated values components are summarized in the table below.</p>

<p>Enumerated value components
Type Characters Explanation
Code Set Text(40) The name of the code set
Code Up to 16 A code for the value. Codes are alphanumeric characters excluding
the ‚Äò-‚Äò character. They are case insensitive. Codes are typically
stored in Text(250) fields because codes may be additive. Separate
code may be appended to each other using the ‚Äú-‚Äú character as a
separator. The 16 character limit does not include extension
prefixes.
Codes are of the form:
(@[A-Z0-9]+:)?([A-Z0-9.]+ | [A-Z0-9.]+[+][A-Z0-9.]+)
‚Äò+‚Äô has a special meaning to support non-conforming code sets.</p>

<p>Parent Code (^) Text(250) The code of the of the parent in a hierarchical coding system. This is
null for top level codes.
Short Name Up to 40 The name of the value intended for use in user interfaces and other
applications with limited space.
Name (^) Up to 100 The full name of the value.
Description (^) Up to 4000 A description of the value.
Tags (^) Up to 10 Synonyms or common usage. Tags are used to enhance search
URL (^) Text(250) Optional URL used as a reference
Enumerated value codes are combine by adding a ‚Äú-‚Äú (dash character) and the next
most specific code as a suffix.
Examples
Code Concatenated Code Short Name
NAM (^) NAM North America
US (^) NA-US United States
US+CA (^) NA-US-US+CA California</p>

<h4 id="322-text-values">3.2.2 Text Values</h4>

<p>Text values are unstructured natural language descriptions intended to be human
readable and informative. Text values are also used to store information not yet</p>

<p>specified by the standard. Text values are intended to be searchable, and subject to
standard text operations.</p>

<h4 id="323-numeric-values">3.2.3 Numeric Values</h4>

<p>Numeric values store scalar numeric information. Numeric values are subject to
common mathematical operations. Numeric values can be floating point, whole number
and boolean.</p>

<h3 id="33-dependencies">3.3 Dependencies</h3>

<p>Dependencies restrict which structural components and which allowed values may
appear in a valid matter instance based on other values in the matter. As an example, if
a process is of type ‚Äútransaction,‚Äù the players in that transaction my not be of the type
‚Äúplaintiff‚Äù or ‚Äúdefendant.‚Äù These values are restricted to process of type ‚Äúdispute.‚Äù
Dependencies are not part of Draft LMSS 1.0 Rev 2.</p>

<h3 id="34-lmss-encodings">3.4 LMSS Encodings</h3>

<p>The LMSS can be encoded machine readable formats. JSON is the baseline supported
format.

<h3 id="35-extensions-to-the-lmss-codes">3.5 Extensions to the LMSS Codes</h3>

<p>The LMSS is intended to be adaptable to the needs of customers. It is our intent that
later versions of the standard will incorporate extensions that have been developed.
The LMSS has a well-defined way to extend enumerated codes.
Codes are extended by:
ÔÇ∑ Defining an extension prefix of the format ‚Äú@&lt;alphanumeric(6)&gt;‚Äù. This prefix
followed by a colon (‚Äú:‚Äù) will be used as a prefix to any extended codes.
ÔÇ∑ Creating and extension code table that conforms to the specification in section
3.2.1.
ÔÇ∑ Embedding the extension table or a reference to it in the header.</p>

<h4 id="351-extension-example">3.5.1 Extension Example‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..</h4>

<p>Law firm AM would like to extend the SALI industry codes to include subcategories of
real estate. In this example the ‚ÄúReal Estate‚Äù industry type with code ‚ÄúRES‚Äù will be
extended by adding subtypes of real estate below it.
The prefix code chosen is ‚Äú@am‚Äù. This prefix is chosen arbitrarily, but in planned
versions of the API, extension keys and be registered and stored to facilitate data
exchange.)</p>

<p>The extension table would have this the following data.

<h2 id="4-structure-of-lmss-document">4 Structure of LMSS Document</h2>

<h3 id="41-overview">4.1 Overview</h3>

<p>The LMSS document is comprised of a Header and one or more Matters. The Header
and the Matter(s) are containers Each container has elements that may be of type Text,
Numeric, Enumeration or Container. Enumerations are stored in Text(250) fields to
accommodate multiple levels of specificity that are represented as concatenated codes.
Containers are pointers to other structures.
A well-formed Document is a structure that includes all required fields. (Note that the
concept of a well-formed document applies to instance but not templates or queries.) In
the tables below, ‚ÄúREQ‚Äù indicates whether the element is required (in an LMSS instance
but not a query), ‚ÄúMULT‚Äù indicates whether multiple values are permitted. A well-formed
document is required in the interchange of instances of matters between systems. A
well-formed document is not required when the LMSS is used in a query. In those
instances, a missing field matches all instances. See LMSS Queries below.</p>

<h3 id="42-document">4.2 Document</h3>

<p>The Document container is the top-level container in the LMSS instance. The Document
must have a Header and one or more Matters.
Document container elements

<h4 id="433-type">4.3.3 Type</h4>

<p>Type refers to the type of the Document. Permissible values include:
ÔÇ∑ Instance ‚Äì An instance encodes a specific matter. Instances have required
containers and elements to be well formed.
ÔÇ∑ Template ‚Äì A template encodes default settings of an instance. Parts of
templates that are not specified are assumed to accept all values. Templates
must adhere to the LMSS container structure, however required elements are
relaxed.
ÔÇ∑ Query ‚Äì A query encodes a database query following a SQL-like structure.
Queries have select, where, order by and limit structures.</p>

<h4 id="434-language">4.3.4 Language</h4>

<p>Language declares the default language of the LMSS structure. Languages follow the
Internet Engineering Task Force recommendation in BCP 47.</p>

<h4 id="435-charset">4.3.5 Charset</h4>

<p>The charset describes the encoding of the characters in the LMSS document. The
default encoding is UTF-8.</p>

<h4 id="436-extension-link">4.3.6 Extension Link</h4>

<p>A link to an extension file that conforms to the LMSS Extension file format.</p>

<h3 id="44-extension">4.4 Extension</h3>

<p>An extension container is an in-document definition of an extension. A document may
include an array of these in the header. The scope applies to the document.
ELEMENT REQ. MULT. TYPE COMMENTS
Code Set Y N Text(40) The code of the code set being extended
Code Y N Text(40) The extension code. Must be unique in the

<h3 id="45-declaration">4.5 Declaration</h3>

<p>A declaration may be used to assign and index to an item to ensure accurate cross
referencing. Declarations are typically used for legal entities but can be used in place of
a Name (See 4.10.1, 4.11.1 and 4.11.2).
A legal person or entity is any human or non-human entity, in other words, any human
being, firm, or government agency that is recognized as having privileges and
obligations, such as having the ability to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.
Entities are used to maintain referential integrity across LMSS structure. For example, if
the matter includes two processes that refer to the same legal entity as in the example,
‚ÄúReview and negotiate project labor agreement for Jane Smith.‚Äù The matter may be
encoded to have two processes ‚Äì one for review and another of negotiation. But the
review and negotiation are the same legal entity. An entity declaration should be used in
this instance and the entity NameID should be used in each process to ensure that it is
understood that the objects of both process are the same.

<h2 id="5-the-legal-matter-application-programming-interfaces-apis">5 The Legal Matter Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)</h2>

<p>LMSS APIs are not supported in Draft LMSS 1. 0 Rev 2.
The LMSS supports several types of APIs:
ÔÇ∑ LMSS Instance
ÔÇ∑ LMSS Queries
ÔÇ∑ LMSS UI/Sych API</p>

<h3 id="51-lmss-instance">5.1 LMSS Instance</h3>

<p>The Instance API is used to create, import and export matters. It also supports default

ÔÇ∑ Helps create conforming matters
ÔÇ∑ Validates matter structures
ÔÇ∑ Supports user-defined extensions</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ÔÇ∑ Supports default values/templates
</code></pre></div></div>
<h3 id="52-lmss-queries">5.2 LMSS Queries</h3>

<p>An important part of the LMSS is to support the querying of data stores against different
criteria. The standard leverages the LMSS definition ‚Äî structure, enumerated values,
text and numeric values ‚Äî to specify search criteria. In these instances sparse version
of the LMSS are applied to develop search criteria.</p>

<h4 id="521-lmss-query-where-clauses">5.2.1 LMSS Query WHERE Clauses</h4>

<p>In the standard SQL queries clauses SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY, the LMSS
template can be used to define the WHERE clauses.
For enumerated values that are filled in, the search uses the ‚Äústarts with‚Äù criteria for
specifying a search. For text and numeric fields, you can apply standard SQL wildcard
matching.
Below are several examples of how this applied.
