			<h1>LMSS Structure</h1>
		</header>
		<h3>1. Overview</h3>
		<p>The LMSS document is comprised of a Header and one or more Matters. The Header and the Matter(s) are containers. Each container has elements that may be of type Text, Numeric, Enumeration or Container. Enumerations are stored in Text(250) fields to accommodate multiple levels of specificity that are represented as concatenated codes. Containers are pointers to other structures.
		</p>
		<p>A well-formed Document is a structure that includes all required fields. (Note that the concept of a well-formed document applies to instance but not templates or queries.) In the tables below, ‚ÄúREQ‚Äù indicates whether the element is required (in an LMSS instance but not a query), ‚ÄúMULT‚Äù indicates whether multiple values are permitted. A well-formed document is required in the interchange of instances of matters between systems. A well-formed document is not required when the LMSS is used in a query. In those instances, a missing field matches all instances. See LMSS Queries below.
		</p>
		<h3>2. Document</h3>
		<p>The Document container is the top-level container in the LMSS instance. The Document must have a Header and one or more Matters.</p>

```
#### 4.3.1 Title

An optional title for the document.

#### 4.3.2 Version

The LMSS version is defined and maintained by SALI. Published version of the
standard may be found at Sali.org

#### 4.3.3 Type

Type refers to the type of the Document. Permissible values include:
ÔÇ∑ Instance ‚Äì An instance encodes a specific matter. Instances have required
containers and elements to be well formed.
ÔÇ∑ Template ‚Äì A template encodes default settings of an instance. Parts of
templates that are not specified are assumed to accept all values. Templates
must adhere to the LMSS container structure, however required elements are
relaxed.
ÔÇ∑ Query ‚Äì A query encodes a database query following a SQL-like structure.
Queries have select, where, order by and limit structures.

#### 4.3.4 Language

Language declares the default language of the LMSS structure. Languages follow the
Internet Engineering Task Force recommendation in BCP 47.


#### 4.3.5 Charset

The charset describes the encoding of the characters in the LMSS document. The
default encoding is UTF-8.

#### 4.3.6 Extension Link

A link to an extension file that conforms to the LMSS Extension file format.

### 4.4 Extension

An extension container is an in-document definition of an extension. A document may
include an array of these in the header. The scope applies to the document.

,"language" : "en-us"
,"charset" : "UTF-8"
,"extension" : [{
"code set" : "SALI-IND"
,"code" : "@MULFAM"
,"parent" : "RES"
,"name" : "Multi-Family Residential"
}
,{
"code set" : "SALI-IND"


,"code" : "@OFFICE"

a previously defined extension. Examples include "RES" or "@OFFICE".

#### 4.4.4 Name

The short name of extension code.


### 4.5 Declaration

A declaration may be used to assign and index to an item to ensure accurate cross
referencing. Declarations are typically used for legal entities but can be used in place of
a Name (See 4.10.1, 4.11.1 and 4.11.2).
A legal person or entity is any human or non-human entity, in other words, any human
being, firm, or government agency that is recognized as having privileges and
obligations, such as having the ability to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.
Entities are used to maintain referential integrity across LMSS structure. For example, if
the matter includes two processes that refer to the same legal entity as in the example,
"Review and negotiate project labor agreement for Jane Smith." The matter may be
encoded to have two processes ‚Äì one for review and another of negotiation. But the
review and negotiation are the same legal entity. An entity declaration should be used in
this instance and the entity NameID should be used in each process to ensure that it is
understood that the objects of both process are the same.
ELEMENT REQ. MULT. TYPE COMMENTS
NameID Y N Text(40) The NameID of the entity. Must be of the
regular expression form \^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{1,39}

### 4.6 Matter

The Matter container encapsulates the information for a matter. There may be more
than one matter per document. The matter must have a title, a human readable

the processes. For example, certain bankruptcy processes are limited to the US
because those processes a defined by US Bankruptcy law.

### 4.9 Process

the subject (Joe Smith) and object (Company X) in the sentence ‚ÄúJoe Smith sued
Company X for $500,000 for breach of contract.‚Äù
The process predicate contains the predecessors or outcomes of the process. In the
sentence above, ‚Äúfor $500,000‚Äù and ‚Äúfor breach of contract.‚Äù

the primary subject of law for the process ‚Äî think the class that‚Äôs the attorney was in
when she learned about the applicable law. The area of law is provided primarily for
context as in the examples, ‚ÄúHe prosecuted the defendant‚Äù and ‚ÄúShe prosecuted the
patent.‚Äù The first is criminal law, the second is intellectual property law.
