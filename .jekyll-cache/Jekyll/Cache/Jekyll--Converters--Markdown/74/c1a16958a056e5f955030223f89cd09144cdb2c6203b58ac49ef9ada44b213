<h2 id="1-overview">1. Overview</h2>

<p>The LMSS document is comprised of a Header and one or more Matters. The Header
and the Matter(s) are containers Each container has elements that may be of type Text,
Numeric, Enumeration or Container. Enumerations are stored in Text(250) fields to
accommodate multiple levels of specificity that are represented as concatenated codes.
Containers are pointers to other structures.</p>

<p>A well-formed Document is a structure that includes all required fields. (Note that the
concept of a well-formed document applies to instance but not templates or queries.) In
the tables below, ‚ÄúREQ‚Äù indicates whether the element is required (in an LMSS instance
but not a query), ‚ÄúMULT‚Äù indicates whether multiple values are permitted. A well-formed
document is required in the interchange of instances of matters between systems. A
well-formed document is not required when the LMSS is used in a query. In those
instances, a missing field matches all instances. See LMSS Queries below.</p>

<h2 id="2-document">2 Document</h2>

<p>The Document container is the top-level container in the LMSS instance. The Document
must have a Header and one or more Matters.

<h3 id="45-declaration">4.5 Declaration</h3>

<p>A declaration may be used to assign and index to an item to ensure accurate cross
referencing. Declarations are typically used for legal entities but can be used in place of
a Name (See 4.10.1, 4.11.1 and 4.11.2).
A legal person or entity is any human or non-human entity, in other words, any human
being, firm, or government agency that is recognized as having privileges and
obligations, such as having the ability to enter into contracts, to sue, and to be sued.
Entities are used to maintain referential integrity across LMSS structure. For example, if
the matter includes two processes that refer to the same legal entity as in the example,
‚ÄúReview and negotiate project labor agreement for Jane Smith.‚Äù The matter may be
encoded to have two processes ‚Äì one for review and another of negotiation. But the
review and negotiation are the same legal entity. An entity declaration should be used in
this instance and the entity NameID should be used in each process to ensure that it is
understood that the objects of both process are the same.

NameID Y N Text(40) The NameID of the entity. Must be of the
